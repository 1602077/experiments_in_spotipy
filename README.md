## Experiments in SpotiPy

I have programmatically connected to Spotify's web API using the Python-based SpotiPy library to download the complete music catalogue of all artists in my Apple Music Library. I have used this dataset to build a series of machine learning models: each of which predict whether or not a song will be a hit. This is contained over the following notebooks in `/scripts`:
  1. Data Collection
  2. Exploratory Analysis
  3. Logistic Regression
  4. Random Forest
  
Please review `Spotify Analysis Report.pdf` for the full details of my analysis which contains the outputs of each component notebooks merged into a pdf for easy viewing.

I hope to extend on this analysis to increase the accuracy of the predictions of my model's through increasing the number of and engineering more features in my dataset, which will allow for each model to learn more complex behaviour that is necessary to predict whether or not a song will be successful.
