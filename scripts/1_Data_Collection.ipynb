While this was not necessary for the analysis - I could have easily generated the list from another source -  I already had the data I thought it would be a nice touch to have a dataset that is personal to my tastes. This has given me a list of 1,084 unique artists for which I have downloaded each of their whole music catelogues - resulting in an output dataset of around 70k songs. I consider myself to have a broad taste in music, but this dataset will naturally contain a skew, if this proves an issue I will combine data from additional sources to balance out my dataset.\n",

Although I have randomly shuffled the artist name input list on each run of the python script, which has allowed me to run multiple threads of my script at the same time, without each script iterating over the same part of the input list. The speed-up gained by this is significantly outweighed by the cost of checking if an artist name has already been processed on each iteration. Saving each artist's data as a seperating file and the merging on completion also allows me to checkpoint my code, in the sense that if the https times out or Spotify forcibly disconnects me I can easily pick up where I left off.\n"
